ERP-11.3.236 unifies the Bookings, Sales Invoices and Supplier Costing register
pages using the approved professional ERP visual direction. All three registers
share the same page-heading hierarchy, primary New action treatment, KPI/status
cards where already available, structured Search & Filter card, compact table
geometry, semantic status pills and row actions. The visual enhancement is
scoped to the exact register routes only; booking workspaces, Sales Invoice
detail/workflow pages and Supplier Costing create/detail workflows retain their
existing behavior. ERP-11.3.235 accounting voucher styling and ERP-11.3.234
sidebar stabilization remain unchanged.

Public /voucher/*, print and PDF routes remain excluded from the shared UI
injection. No accounting formula, posted-journal authority, booking workflow,
voucher workflow, ledger, permission or persistence behavior changes. This
release introduces no migration and performs no data mutation.

After manual deployment, clear Application Cache and Ctrl+F5. Verify the
Dashboard shell first, then visually inspect navigation, representative booking,
accounting, ledger, reporting, master-data and system pages. Confirm Profit &
Loss remains HTTP 200, Balance Sheet and Trial Balance remain balanced, and no
records are posted or modified during visual UAT.

First verify booking BK-2026-000054. Internal Client Voucher Preview and its
opaque public /voucher/<token> QR destination must both load. The voucher must use the
saved /organization/company name and report logo, not its fallback mark. With
The real logo must appear once only, preserve its aspect ratio, and remain within
an 80 x 80 pixel maximum box in both Client Preview and Print / Save PDF. With
the selected Pakistan Visa / IATA footer blank, the saved Company Default
Voucher Footer must appear once below Special Instructions and must not overlap
the controlled QR placeholder.

Then use Print / Save PDF and verify the same logo/footer and A4 flow. Visa No.
must remain mapped only by stable passenger ID; no standalone Visa table or
Vendor Account, cost, exchange-rate, margin, or supplier accounting data may
appear.
