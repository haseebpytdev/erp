ERP-11.3.235 refreshes the accounting cash/bank voucher workspace using the
approved professional ERP visual direction. Voucher modes use compact segmented
navigation, voucher creation actions use a separate compact toolbar, search and
filtering use a structured card treatment, and summary values use a balanced
three-column dashboard layout. Receipt, Payment, Expense, Contra, Customer
Advance, Supplier Advance, voucher detail/workflow and Advance Adjustment pages
share the same visual system. ERP-11.3.234 sidebar first-paint stabilization and
approved sidebar spacing remain unchanged.

Public /voucher/*, print and PDF routes remain excluded from the shared UI
injection. No accounting formula, posted-journal authority, booking workflow,
voucher workflow, ledger, permission or persistence behavior changes. This
release introduces no migration and performs no data mutation.

After manual deployment, clear Application Cache and Ctrl+F5. Verify the
Dashboard shell first, then visually inspect navigation, representative booking,
accounting, ledger, reporting, master-data and system pages. Confirm Profit &
Loss remains HTTP 200, Balance Sheet and Trial Balance remain balanced, and no
records are posted or modified during visual UAT.

First verify booking BK-2026-000054. Internal Client Voucher Preview and its
opaque public /voucher/<token> QR destination must both load. The voucher must use the
saved /organization/company name and report logo, not its fallback mark. With
The real logo must appear once only, preserve its aspect ratio, and remain within
an 80 x 80 pixel maximum box in both Client Preview and Print / Save PDF. With
the selected Pakistan Visa / IATA footer blank, the saved Company Default
Voucher Footer must appear once below Special Instructions and must not overlap
the controlled QR placeholder.

Then use Print / Save PDF and verify the same logo/footer and A4 flow. Visa No.
must remain mapped only by stable passenger ID; no standalone Visa table or
Vendor Account, cost, exchange-rate, margin, or supplier accounting data may
appear.
