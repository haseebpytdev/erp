# Easy Ticket ERP — Current Local Authority

`CURRENT` is now the sole editable development authority. Future changes are
made and tested in this directory without creating versioned source copies or
automatic ZIP archives.

Only an explicit `PREPARE DEPLOYMENT` request authorizes release-number review,
full release validation, and creation of one package in `D:\Easy Ticket\ERP\DEPLOY`.
Deployment remains manual; this cleanup did not modify production.

Baseline proof: the former `.156` package matched the SHA-256 above, reported
the same application version, and independently extracted to 151 files that
matched all 151 files in the former `FINAL\source` tree byte-for-byte.
